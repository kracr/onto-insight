5/25/2025 13:14:54,,Student (Technical background),<1 Year,,,Both,Both,I tested the tool first using a university ontology having information regarding the professors and the courses offered and then using a publically avalabe ontology :  https://openscience.adaptcentre.ie/ontologies/GConsent/docs/ontology which provides a higher level frame work to model consent as per the GDPR guidlines,4,,3,5,2,Both,No,Yes,,,"I like the report generation and the suggested improvements part of the tool. The suggestions, though solely based on mathematical metrics,  are actually useful to some extent in pinpointing the errors and actually lead to a potential solution to some of the problems in the modelled axioms.",,,,3,1,,4,5,4,4,"I would definitely prefer this tool as a web application, since, if I am using an iterative methodology like Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD) for developing my ontology in modules, then after the creation of each module of the ontology, I would prefer to upload the created module of the ontology to the web-application, as that would allow me to test my created module then and there and I can apply some of the suggestions provided by the tool, to my module before merging with the master ontology. This would allow me to make my smaller modules much more coherent, and hence the larger ontology coherent as well. ",Yes,"1) The explanation of the metrics in the advanced report can be improved a little. Rather than just giving out the number with the explanation of the metric, a better way could have been to actually give how exactly was that calculated. For example, if RROnto = 0.0857,  and RROnto  = Num Properties/(Num Properties + Num Class Definitions), then the number of properties,  class definitions should also be specified, so that just by looking at the report, one can understand how that metric was achieved.

2) A little more explanation in the modular report, as to why the given module was selected based on the seed term and how exactly the modularisation is working, as in how it is decided which axioms to include in the module created. Since the criteria for choosing the seed-term were clear, however, how exactly the modularization is happening seemed a bit unclear and should be included in the report.

3)  Suggestion: Having the option to decide if I want to focus on a certain metric or not.  ",,

Also, any LLMs suffer from hallucinations so the metric should be showing the mean of 5 independent runs and standard deviation. This will make the paper stronger.
