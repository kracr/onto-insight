OQuaRE,ANOnto,ANOnto measures the mean number of annotations per class in the ontology. It reflects the extent of additional information or metadata associated with class definitions.,>0.8,<0.2,(annotationAsserionAxioms + generalAnnotationAxioms)/classes
OQuaRE,AROnto,AROnto measures the mean number of attributes (properties) per class in the ontology. It reflects the complexity and richness of attribute definitions within class definitions.,>0.8,<0.2,(dataPropertyDomainAxioms + objectPropertyDomainAxioms)/classes
OQuaRE,CBOnto,CBOOnto quantifies the number of related classes in the ontology. It assesses the interdependence or coupling between classes.,1-3,>12,superClasses/(classes-rootClasses)

OQuaRE,LCOMOnto,This metric measures the semantic and conceptual relatedness of classes in an ontology. It quantifies the separation of responsibilities and independence of components within the ontology.,1-2,>8,Summation of Length of Path i from root to leaf/Summation of leaf classes i
OQuaRE,NACOnto,This metric calculates the mean number of ancestor classes per leaf class in the ontology. It reflects the inheritance hierarchy and relationships between classes.,1-2,>8,superClassesOfLeafClasses/absoluteLeafCardinality
OQuaRE,NOCOnto,NOCOnto measures the mean number of direct subclasses for each class in the ontology. It indicates the breadth or branching factor of the ontology hierarchy.,1-2,>8,subClassOfAxioms/(classes - rootClasses)

rectly accessible from each class in the ontology. It reflects the complexity and richness of
 class definitions in terms of their associated properties",1-3,>12,(subClassOfAxioms/(classes-rootClasses))*(datapropertyAssertionAxioms+objectPropertyOnClasses)

with more than 1 direct ancestor",1-2,>8,superClassesOfClassesWithMultipleInheritance/classesWithMultipleInheritance
